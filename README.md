# cabal-irc

This is an cabal-irc-bouncer, It let's you connect to
the cabal p2p network using whichever irc-client you prefer.

Usage:


cabal-irc [key|dbpath]

Fore more help run

cabal-irc --help

(readme is work in progress, we don't actually have an `cabal-irc` executable
right now.
just clone this project and run `node cli.js` to figure out how it works)
